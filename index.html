        { date: "01/01/2024", content: "ちょうど年を跨ぐころ、僕は半蔵門線に揺られていた。イタリア人の同僚が催した大晦日パーティーからの帰宅途中だった。家に着いて九品仏に向かった。自分のこと、衛星打ち上げ、作曲、母のこと、個展、家族のこと、健康、安全… 一通り願っていたら、隣の参拝者の二巡分の時間を使っていた。おみくじは中吉、これら三つは心に刻んでおこう。1. あたたかき愛をなみなみと注ぐ家族に感謝しよう。本物の優しさの中には厳しさもある。愛に満ち足りた人生を歩むには、上辺の言葉に惑わされず心を見る力をつけること。2. 叶うと信じることで願いが現実のものになる。3. 旅先で思わぬ素敵な出会いあり。2024年、どうぞよろしく。" },
        { date: "01/02/2024", content: "The second sunrise to the world was the first sunrise to us. I went hiking on Mt.Sunrise with my confidants. The moment Sun showed itself from the clouds was exceptionally beautiful and satisfying. I wish I had fully relied myself on its nature but my right hand was holding onto the phone tight, trying to capture the new year's moment. What has this world become, or rather, what have I become? Do I find values in pictorial evidences? But happiness intesifies when shared amongst important ones. Starting to have doubts... 記録に残したのは、他者からの羨望という優越感に浸りたいためか、大切な人と幸せな経験を共有するためか。どっちもな気がする。醜い一面と素直な一面が共存している、それが僕という人間だ。" },
        { date: "01/03/2024", content: "Following the plane fire accident, the airport was a bit crowded but luckily my plane flew as planned. Or unluckily... I knew I was sick when I boarded with my nose running endlessly. I landed. Met my parents, grandparents, cousins, had lunch and got home. I told my mum: 我感冒不應該回來的. She replied: 謝謝你回來,  這樣我才可以在你身邊安心的照顧你. Love your family, treasure them, embrace them, forgive them, appreciate them, it's ineffable how important they are to you. Today, you are standing on top of their sacrifices called 'Love'." },
        { date: "01/04/2024", content: "Tested. Covid. Positive. Dead. Whole Day. Peace Out." },
        { date: "01/05/2024", content: "A bit late but I started this diary thing today after Haku's message on LINE reminded me. I spent good amount of time writing the web structure and entries for the past few days I missed, but it wasn't a pain. They say having a good environment is really important to do any sort of tasks. I guess it's true, having this little space on the internet set up for myself is kind of fun and exciting. If you found me, these are all yours to read, enjoy!!" },
        { date: "01/06/2024", content: "金正恩から見舞いの電報があった。「日本が不幸にも新年の初めから地震による多くの人命被害と物質的な損失を被ったという知らせに接した。遺族と被害者に深い同情と哀悼の意を表する。」演技なのか、貸しなのか、保険なのか、形なのか。誰かへの訴えなのか。誰への訴えなのだ。真相はわからない。だから勘繰るのはやめにしよう。真摯に受け止めよう。謝意を示そう。疑ってばかりでは何も変わらない。確かなことは一つ、この震災を受けて何かを感じたということ。その何かが前に進むきっかけなのかもしれない。" },
        { date: "01/07/2024", content: "Declined the ISAK parents dinner invitation with a bit of leftover throat-ache. In the mean time, I thought I could work on the idea contest for ASTROSCALE but slacked off... Ended up purchasing a lifetime license for a hard drive data recovery software to fix all the damaged files in my most important external hard drive. I realised how much I value memories in the form of digital data and felt a monumental fear losing them. Am I afraid of forgetting everything when I become older? I don't really know. But now, I just hope all the data will be recovered. Nothing to be ashamed of in holding on to the beautiful past." },
        { date: "01/08/2024", content: "Recovery workout session felt so good. Haven't really used my muscles or sweated in a week so it really was refreshing to be able to pump and run again! Anyway, I've been giving my thoughts around the space idea contest held by my company for the whole evening but nothing has sparked yet... Space x AI, Sports, Art, Education. They all sound interesting but can't think of aha examples. ChatGPT's helpful for speculating the worldwide issues in 2050 but they all sound banal. I tend to pursue originality and different angles in these type of idea contests. This I think comes from the background that I was always the outlier in the environment and the influences from my really really cool special parents. 出る杭は打たれるっていうけど、僕は打たれなかった杭、受け入れられた杭。So that just boosted my confidence in being special. Aight, I can talk forever about this but it's past midnight already, time is limited, back to the idea contest, I'll just go and explore: Collection and Transfer Methods of Solar Energy in Space!" },
        { date: "01/09/2024", content: "So at the end of the day, I couldn't AND didn't submit my idea. I'm partially disappointed in myself, partially justifying myself. I had come up with ideas but I definitely did not leave enough time for myself to do the research. The ideas I thought were cool and new were found with just a quick look up that they've already been explored since the late 1900s or something, so that didn't help at all in pressing the submit button. With 15 mins left, I tried to come up with wild ideas but I definitely wanted to spend more time, warm it up and polish it up. I was scared of submitting some half-ass idea just for the sake of submission, just because I ran out of time. No more excuses, I just gave up (angel emoji). This is similar to a situation where you had a question in mind, but thought it was a stupid question or couldn't form it well in mind so just kept the question unasked. I do this quite often actually. Well, I'm definitely missing opportunities there but, in a sense, that could be seen as a silence of future investment. Alright, I'm rambling again, I'll shut my mouth for the day. P.S. RitsuUji x TJS gang was a fun group to hang <3" },
        { date: "01/10/2024", content: "Highlight of the day was the small reunion we had in Yokohama and here are the three quotes from Ata 2024: 1. Is there military service in Afganistan? No we leave that to the Taliban. 2. I was writing my EE on the Taliban, had printed many pictures of them and had it in my suitcase. I got caught in the customs and they saw the pictures. Officers were saying 大丈夫ですよ but I knew they were freaking out inside. I was released from that situation then but later, I heard the Narita airport called Mr.Jemison, the head of the school, for confirmation... 3. Nippon Foundation raises money from boat racing. Man, I love his dark humour." },
        { date: "01/11/2024", content: "The launch got postponed again... I knew the space industry will hardly ever go as planned but I'm quite sick of the postponement news already. The ADRAS-J count down poster has become a count up poster I swear.. ahaha... Well, meanwhile other projects have really kicked off and sinked in my schedule so I can see my self working extra hours again soon.. ahaha... Well, the new simulator development and state of the art algorithm implementations are exciting so I will look forward to those!" },
        { date: "01/12/2024", content: "中国の平和に対する考え方「中国は平和的発展を堅持するが、発展は平和よりも尊い。中国は平和的台頭を堅持するが、台頭は平和よりも尊い。中国は平和的解決を堅持するが、主権は平和よりも尊い。中国は平和的統一を堅持するが、統一は平和よりも尊い。我々は平和を犠牲にすることで統一を死守しなければならない。中国は平和的外交を堅持するが、中国外交の原則は平和よりも尊い。平和には性質的区分というものがある。平等、公正、正義の原則に基づいた平和もあれば、妥協、譲歩、屈服、売国、投降によって得られる平和もある。挑発者を前にして、闘争しなければ平和は生まれる。圧迫者を前にして、抗争しなければ平和は生まれる。侵略者を前にして、抵抗しなければ平和は生まれる。つまり、すべての平和が栄光あるものではないということだ。原則を失った平和は、屈辱でしかないのだ。」イスラエルの論理「誰かが殺しに来たら立ち向かいこちらが先に殺せ。国家がなければ生き残れない。自分たちは常に存亡の危機にある。戦わなければ生き残れない。世界を敵に回してでも戦う。」決してこれを理由に武力行使に賛同するわけではないが、他国の視点を知ることは非常に重要だと思う。背景は何か、モチベーションは何か、夢は何か。そこを理解することで、解決の筋道が立つのだと思う。" },
        { date: "01/13/2024", content: "中学の同級生が、白金に4階建ての一軒家を買いました。今日行きました。エレベーターありました。どこからツッコめばいいのかわからなかったです。もう婚約して月末に籍を入れるそうです。早いですね。いろんな生き方があるんですね。中学の頃は二人ともガキだったのに、もういい歳です。彼は三菱電気なので将来宇宙分野で一緒にコラボしたいですわ。" },
        { date: "01/14/2024", content: "We have this wholesome chat among the beefcakes from the class of 2017 at ISAK, and everytime someone sends his gym pic, we just encourage and hype each other to death. This one came from Wes and I thought it was beautifully written so I might as well just share it here haha. 'My boi’s ass so perky that it looks like mount fuji got cloned side by side. His shoulders so defined, got me questioning my straightness. The V taper got me wondering bout that saber he be hiding under. Sex god forreal cant nobody resist him.' Honestly, he's one of the most important friends to me, and I wish he could come to the summer school this year so we could hang about, catch up and fool around like the old days." },
        { date: "01/15/2024", content: "Edited two videos for the ISAK Alumni Giving Campaign. This is the unpaid work I signed up for. But no regrets. It's quite fun to reconnect with people and getting attention on my creation :) If you wanna have a watch, here you go! -> https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjH-BBNqp9eFAEwBoBDmsF7gXtBOrlH21&si=oKQrD4Y68xJklydB " },
        { date: "01/16/2024", content: "Sometimes I just think out of the blue: 'Did I get worse at singing? Would I never be able to sing like I used to?' there's a bit of fear in it and today that happened again when I was singing in the shower. I don't know if there's a name to this psychological behaviour, if it is even a psychological behaviour. But most of the time, the cause is like a sickness or something that undermined my throat temporarily. This time it was covid, and I hope I can get back to normal singing again soon! " },
        { date: "01/17/2024", content: "Talked to Saki about ISAK summer school 2024. I'm invited as a faculty member and I can design any course I want to teach through 3 workshops, she said. Man, I'm excited for this and I will have to take nearly 3 weeks off from Astroscale but I think it's worth it and the environment change will definitely feel fresh and provide me growth as well. For now I'm thinking one workshop where we think about 'What if the Kessler Syndrome occured and worldwide internet died tomorrow?', one for building water bottle rockets, and the final one for exploring who we are and the unknowns, finding the meaning of finding the meaning of life." },
        { date: "01/18/2024", content: "Had dinner with Hiro, one of my colleagues at Astroscale and I was telling him it's getting busier at work, I listed what I was working on at the moment and I think it got up to 10 tasks... I was surprised myself too. Oh well, responsibility comes with experience I guess and I should be happy about it!" },
        { date: "01/19/2024", content: "言葉とかアイデアみたいに中身がなくて表層的で簡単に見えることが、実は日本人にとって1番難しい。日本人が今まで活躍してきた領域をみると、モノを作って売るとか、スポーツで誰の目にも明らかな成績で勝つ、みたいな言葉が介在しないハードな世界でだけ戦うことができたと思う。逆にビジネスの領域では、言葉やアイデアによって作られるブランドビジネスやラグジュアリービジネスにおいては日本の存在感はゼロ。ソフトウェアや情報、メディアのレイヤーでも厳しい。1番重要のはイデオロギーや価値観設計のところで、明治以降、価値を測る尺度を海外から輸入して、その尺度で戦うということを強いられてきて、気づいたら強いられているということも忘れてしまって、それが当然の営みであるかのように、自分たちを自己洗脳してしまっている。それは今のSDGsなどを見れば明らかで、引いては企業の時価総額や国のGDPなど、全部そう。特にこれからの高齢化と人口減少ステージになってくると、経済的な絶対力で物事の尺度を図るのは、どんどん日本にとって厳しくなる。一国のGDPや企業の時価総額の合計で競争するのが厳しくなる現実がある。だとすると、自分たちが戦える方向に、いかにルールを組み替えるかが大事になってくると思う。これは日本の「弱さ」というよりは、ただ「意識していない」ということだと考える。日本は良くも悪しくも同じような人たちで作られた社会である。大体多くの人が日本語のネイティブで、同じような見た目で、大体同じ文化を共有している。その阿吽の呼吸、言わなくても伝わるという性質が、いい方向で働くと、チームプレイで、まめにお互いを監視しあって勤勉に働くとか、治安がいいとか、街が綺麗だとか、になる。ただ悪い方向にいくと、自分たちが何をしようとしているのか、どういう目的のもと、どういう制約のもと動いているのかということを説明したり、明示化したり、ぶつけ合ったりするということが苦手になってしまう。それをする必要性ないから。必要ないと大体退化していく。それを繰り返してきた結果が今だと思う。逆にそれを意識さえすれば、日本ほど変な国はないから、自分たちが暗黙に作り出してしまっている価値観や世界観があるはずだから、いかにそれを言葉にしていくか、壊していくか、再建していくか。今後、コンテンツ産業が重要になる中で、一体自分たちが何をやろうとしているのか、どのような世界観を作っているのかを説明できるリーダーが必要だ。" },
        { date: "01/20/2024", content: "I'm on ski trip so will update tomorrow!" },
        { date: "01/21/2024", content: "First snowboarding experience was so fun, I picked it up quite quickly cos I had skateboarding background but didn't tell Masaru and Kohei about it. So they kept telling me that my growth curve was insane, oh it felt good haha but overall it was a super fulfilling and fun weekend trip with some deep conversaitons about cultures and identities on the way to and back from the resort, some good snow sessions, delicious Nigata local food, night fun with Ito and a good onsen to finish off the trip. Seriously considering buying the full snowboarder package... Oh btw, the two boys took my snowboard virgin as well as my Nigata virgin." },
        { date: "01/22/2024", content: "I had this sympton where I couldn't refuse anything from anybody but finally I'm starting to learn how to say No. Today I had one gym appointment but my work's quite busy and my shoulder's hurt from snowboarding so I said no. Later that day, I was called out to eat dinner and hang out with my junior high school mates but I also wasn't feeling it so I said no. Syaing no to others is sometimes a result of laziness but often times a protection for one's self. Setting appropriate priorities are really important to have constant sense of purpose and awareness for life. And I'm glad that I'm slowly starting to learn how that works." },
        { date: "01/23/2024", content: "I'll admit, it does feel different this time. General purpose cognition feels so close to what we all treasure about humanity. But we will still keep focusing on ourselves, work with other people and coordinate. I think Everyone's job will look a lot more like that, we will all operate at a little higher level of abstraction, we will all have access to a lot more capability and we will still make decisions about what should happen in the world. - Sam Altman @ World Economic Forum 2024" },
        { date: "01/24/2024", content: "Dad came to Tokyo and we had a discussion on the World Economic Forum including the China-Taiwan relation, Future with AI and Space Exploration. It was interesting how we shared quite a similar perspective on everything yet the attitudes are the completely opposite where I tend to be more optimistic while my dad being pessimistic. Maybe that comes from the experience, or personality I don't really know, but one thing I'm sure is, I hope to stay optimistic for the rest of my life. There's more fun in expecting for sure!" },
        { date: "01/25/2024", content: "They said one of the thrusters failed during decent and the nav cam captured a nozzle-like object falling towards the lunar surface... I can't seem to image how this can happen other than cheeky lunarians physically attacking the lander lol Also, I remember watching the recorded live stream in the morning of the ski trip day and seeing the lander flipping upside down for a moment. Now it has become clear why it displayed what it displayed haha Anyway, I think it was a huge achievement including SLIM, LEV1 and LEV2, congrats!" },
