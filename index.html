        { date: "01/01/2024", content: "ちょうど年を跨ぐころ、僕は半蔵門線に揺られていた。イタリア人の同僚が催した大晦日パーティーからの帰宅途中だった。家に着いて九品仏に向かった。自分のこと、衛星打ち上げ、作曲、母のこと、個展、家族のこと、健康、安全… 一通り願っていたら、隣の参拝者の二巡分の時間を使っていた。おみくじは中吉、これら三つは心に刻んでおこう。1. あたたかき愛をなみなみと注ぐ家族に感謝しよう。本物の優しさの中には厳しさもある。愛に満ち足りた人生を歩むには、上辺の言葉に惑わされず心を見る力をつけること。2. 叶うと信じることで願いが現実のものになる。3. 旅先で思わぬ素敵な出会いあり。2024年、どうぞよろしく。" },
        { date: "01/02/2024", content: "The second sunrise to the world was the first sunrise to us. I went hiking on Mt.Sunrise with my confidants. The moment Sun showed itself from the clouds was exceptionally beautiful and satisfying. I wish I had fully relied myself on its nature but my right hand was holding onto the phone tight, trying to capture the new year's moment. What has this world become, or rather, what have I become? Do I find values in pictorial evidences? But happiness intesifies when shared amongst important ones. Starting to have doubts... 記録に残したのは、他者からの羨望という優越感に浸りたいためか、大切な人と幸せな経験を共有するためか。どっちもな気がする。醜い一面と素直な一面が共存している、それが僕という人間だ。" },
        { date: "01/03/2024", content: "Following the plane fire accident, the airport was a bit crowded but luckily my plane flew as planned. Or unluckily... I knew I was sick when I boarded with my nose running endlessly. I landed. Met my parents, grandparents, cousins, had lunch and got home. I told my mum: 我感冒不應該回來的. She replied: 謝謝你回來,  這樣我才可以在你身邊安心的照顧你. Love your family, treasure them, embrace them, forgive them, appreciate them, it's ineffable how important they are to you. Today, you are standing on top of their sacrifices called 'Love'." },
        { date: "01/04/2024", content: "Tested. Covid. Positive. Dead. Whole Day. Peace Out." },
        { date: "01/05/2024", content: "A bit late but I started this diary thing today after Haku's message on LINE reminded me. I spent good amount of time writing the web structure and entries for the past few days I missed, but it wasn't a pain. They say having a good environment is really important to do any sort of tasks. I guess it's true, having this little space on the internet set up for myself is kind of fun and exciting. If you found me, these are all yours to read, enjoy!!" },
        { date: "01/06/2024", content: "金正恩から見舞いの電報があった。「日本が不幸にも新年の初めから地震による多くの人命被害と物質的な損失を被ったという知らせに接した。遺族と被害者に深い同情と哀悼の意を表する。」演技なのか、貸しなのか、保険なのか、形なのか。誰かへの訴えなのか。誰への訴えなのだ。真相はわからない。だから勘繰るのはやめにしよう。真摯に受け止めよう。謝意を示そう。疑ってばかりでは何も変わらない。確かなことは一つ、この震災を受けて何かを感じたということ。その何かが前に進むきっかけなのかもしれない。" },
        { date: "01/07/2024", content: "Declined the ISAK parents dinner invitation with a bit of leftover throat-ache. In the mean time, I thought I could work on the idea contest for ASTROSCALE but slacked off... Ended up purchasing a lifetime license for a hard drive data recovery software to fix all the damaged files in my most important external hard drive. I realised how much I value memories in the form of digital data and felt a monumental fear losing them. Am I afraid of forgetting everything when I become older? I don't really know. But now, I just hope all the data will be recovered. Nothing to be ashamed of in holding on to the beautiful past." },
        { date: "01/08/2024", content: "Recovery workout session felt so good. Haven't really used my muscles or sweated in a week so it really was refreshing to be able to pump and run again! Anyway, I've been giving my thoughts around the space idea contest held by my company for the whole evening but nothing has sparked yet... Space x AI, Sports, Art, Education. They all sound interesting but can't think of aha examples. ChatGPT's helpful for speculating the worldwide issues in 2050 but they all sound banal. I tend to pursue originality and different angles in these type of idea contests. This I think comes from the background that I was always the outlier in the environment and the influences from my really really cool special parents. 出る杭は打たれるっていうけど、僕は打たれなかった杭、受け入れられた杭。So that just boosted my confidence in being special. Aight, I can talk forever about this but it's past midnight already, time is limited, back to the idea contest, I'll just go and explore: Collection and Transfer Methods of Solar Energy in Space!" },
